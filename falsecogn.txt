Not to be confused with False friend.

False cognates are pairs of words that seem to be cognates because of similar
sounds and meaning, but have different etymologies; they can be within the same
language or from different languages, even within the same family.^[1] For
example, the English word dog and the Mbabaram word dog have exactly the same
meaning and very similar pronunciations, but by complete coincidence. Likewise,
English much and Spanish mucho came by their similar meanings via completely
different Proto-Indo-European roots, and same for English have and Spanish
haber. This is different from false friends, which are similar-sounding words
with different meanings, and may or may not be cognates.

Even though false cognates lack a common root, there may still be an indirect
connection between them (for example by phono-semantic matching or folk
etymology).

Phenomenon

edit

The term "false cognate" is sometimes misused to refer to false friends, but
the two phenomena are distinct.^[1]^[2] False friends occur when two words in
different languages or dialects look similar, but have different meanings.
While some false friends are also false cognates, many are genuine cognates
(see False friends ¬ß Causes).^[2] For example, English pretend and French
pr√©tendre are false friends, but not false cognates, as they have the same
origin.^[3]

"Mama and papa" type

edit

The basic kinship terms mama and papa comprise a special case of false
cognates; many languages share words of similar form and meaning for these
kinship terms, but due to common processes of language acquisition rather than
relatedness of the languages.^[4]^[5]^[6]^[7]

Examples

Note: Some etymologies may be simplified to avoid overly long descriptions.

False cognates used in the coinage of new words

edit

The coincidental similarity between false cognates can sometimes be used in the
creation of new words (neologization). For example, the Hebrew word ◊ì÷∑÷º◊ú dal
("poor") (which is a false cognate of the phono-semantically similar English
word dull) is used in the new Israeli Hebrew expression ◊ê◊ô◊ü ◊®◊í◊¢ ◊ì◊ú en rega dal
(literally "There is no poor moment") as a phono-semantic matching for the
English expression Never a dull moment.^[21]

Similarly, the Hebrew word ◊ì◊ô◊ë◊ï◊ë dib√∫v ("speech, inducing someone to speak"),
which is a false cognate of (and thus etymologically unrelated to) the
phono-semantically similar English word dubbing, is then used in the Israeli
phono-semantic matching for dubbing. The result is that in Modern Hebrew, ◊ì◊ô◊ë◊ï◊ë
dib√∫v means "dubbing".^[22]

    conceptually as well as etymologically, it differs considerably from the
    false cognate 'saint' which is often used to translate it. Like 'saint',
    'sant' has also taken on the more general ethical meaning of the 'good

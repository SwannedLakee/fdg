<h3>BMC1: Rule Index</h3>

	<div id="metaarea">
		<ul class="translator">
		<li>By Thannissaro bhikkhu</li>
		</ul>
</div>

<p>This index lists the summaries of the training rules given in this book, organized by topic. The Sekhiya rules have not been included, because they are short, deal almost exclusively with etiquette, and are already organized by topic in their own chapter. I have included short summaries of the adhikaraṇa-samatha rules, even though these summaries do not appear in the chapter discussing those rules.</p>

<p>The rules are divided into five major categories, dealing with Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood, Communal harmony, and the etiquette of a contemplative. The first three categories — the factors of the Noble Eightfold Path that make up the training in heightened virtue — show in particular how the training rules relate to the Buddhist path as a whole.</p>

<p>These five categories are not sharply distinct types. Instead, they are more like the colors in the band of light thrown off by a prism — discernably different, but shading into one another with no sharp dividing lines. Right Speech, for instance, often shades into Communal harmony, just as Right Livelihood shades into personal etiquette. Thus the placement of a particular rule in one category rather than another is occasionally somewhat arbitrary. There are a few cases — such as <a href="../bmc/bmc1.8-5.html#pc46">Pācittiya&nbsp;46</a> &amp; <a href="../bmc/bmc1.8-9.html#pc85">85</a> — where the reason for the placement of the rule will become clear only after a reading of the detailed discussion of the rule in the text.</p>

<h4>Right Speech</h4>

<p><a href="../mn/mn117.html#speech">MN117</a> defines <i>wrong speech</i> as lying, divisive speech, abusive speech, and idle chatter.</p>

<h5>Lying</h5>

<p>Making an unfounded charge to a bhikkhu that he has committed a pārājika offense, in hopes of having him disrobed, is a saṅghādisesa offense. (<a href="../bmc/bmc1.5.html#sg8">Saṅghādisesa&nbsp;8</a>)</p>

<p>Distorting the evidence while accusing a bhikkhu of having committed a pārājika offense, in hopes of having him disrobed, is a saṅghādisesa offense. (<a href="../bmc/bmc1.5.html#sg9">Saṅghādisesa&nbsp;9</a>)</p>

<p>The intentional effort to misrepresent the truth to another individual is a pācittiya offense. (<a href="../bmc/bmc1.8-1.html#pc1">Pācittiya&nbsp;1</a>)</p>

<p>Making an unfounded charge to a bhikkhu — or getting someone else to make the charge to him — that he is guilty of a saṅghādisesa offense is a pācittiya offense. (<a href="../bmc/bmc1.8-8.html#pc76">Pācittiya&nbsp;76</a>)</p>

<h5>Divisive speech</h5>

<h5>Abusive speech</h5>

<p>An insult made with malicious intent to another bhikkhu is a pācittiya offense. (<a href="../bmc/bmc1.8-1.html#pc2">Pācittiya&nbsp;2</a>)</p>

<h5>Idle chatter</h5>

<p>Visiting lay families — without having informed an available bhikkhu — before or after a meal to which one has been invited is a pācittiya offense except during the robe season or any time one is making a robe. (<a href="../bmc/bmc1.8-5.html#pc46">Pācittiya&nbsp;46</a>)</p>

<p>Entering a village, town, or city during the period after noon until the following dawn, without having taken leave of an available bhikkhu — unless there is an emergency — is a pācittiya offense. (<a href="../bmc/bmc1.8-9.html#pc85">Pācittiya&nbsp;85</a>)</p>

<h4>Right Action</h4>

<p><a href="../mn/mn117.html">MN117</a> defines <i>wrong action</i> as killing living beings, taking what is not given, and engaging in sexual misconduct.</p>

<h5>Killing</h5>

<p>Intentionally bringing about the death of a human being, even if it is still a fetus — whether by killing the person, arranging for an assassin to kill the person, inciting the person to die, or describing the advantages of death — is a pārājika offense. (<a href="../bmc/bmc1.4.html#pr3">Pārājika 3</a>)</p>

<p>Pouring water that one knows to contain living beings — or having it poured — on grass or clay is a pācittiya offense. Pouring anything that would kill the beings into such water — or having it poured — is also a pācittiya offense. (<a href="../bmc/bmc1.8-2.html#pc20">Pācittiya&nbsp;20</a>)</p>

<p>Deliberately killing an animal — or having it killed — is a pācittiya offense. (<a href="../bmc/bmc1.8-7.html#pc61">Pācittiya&nbsp;61</a>)</p>

<p>Using water, or getting others to use it, knowing that it contains living beings that will die from that use, is a pācittiya offense. (<a href="../bmc/bmc1.8-7.html#pc62">Pācittiya&nbsp;62</a>)</p>

<h5>Taking what is not given</h5>

<p>The theft of anything worth 124 ounce troy of gold or more is a pārājika offense. (<a href="../bmc/bmc1.4.html#pr2">Pārājika 2</a>)</p>

<p>Having given another bhikkhu a robe on a condition and then — angry and displeased — snatching it back or having it snatched back is a nissaggiya pācittiya offense. (<a href="../bmc/bmc1.7-3.html#np25">Nissaggiya Pācittiya&nbsp;25</a>)</p>

<p>Making use of cloth or a bowl stored under shared ownership — unless the shared ownership has been rescinded or one is taking the item on trust — is a pācittiya offense. (<a href="../bmc/bmc1.8-6.html#pc59">Pācittiya&nbsp;59</a>)</p>

<h5>Sexual Misconduct</h5>

<p>Voluntary sexual intercourse — genital, anal, or oral — with a human being, non-human being, or common animal is a pārājika offense. (<a href="../bmc/bmc1.4.html#pr1">Pārājika 1</a>)</p>

<p>Intentionally causing oneself to emit semen, or getting someone else to cause one to emit semen — except during a dream — is a saṅghādisesa offense. (<a href="../bmc/bmc1.5.html#sg1">Saṅghādisesa&nbsp;1</a>)</p>

<p>Making a lustful remark to a woman about her genitals, anus or about performing sexual intercourse is a saṅghādisesa offense. (<a href="../bmc/bmc1.5.html#sg3">Saṅghādisesa&nbsp;3</a>)</p>

<p>Telling a woman that having sexual intercourse with a bhikkhu would be beneficial is a saṅghādisesa offense. (<a href="../bmc/bmc1.5.html#sg4">Saṅghādisesa&nbsp;4</a>)</p>

<p>Getting an unrelated bhikkhunī to wash, dye, or beat a robe that has been used at least once is a nissaggiya pācittiya offense. (<a href="../bmc/bmc1.7-1.html#np4">Nissaggiya Pācittiya&nbsp;4</a>)</p>

<p>Getting an unrelated bhikkhunī to wash, dye, or card wool that has not been made into cloth or yarn is a nissaggiya pācittiya offense. (<a href="../bmc/bmc1.7-2.html#np17">Nissaggiya Pācittiya&nbsp;17</a>)</p>

<p>Teaching more than six sentences of Dhamma to a woman, except in response to a question, is a pācittiya offense unless a knowledgeable man is present. (<a href="../bmc/bmc1.8-1.html#pc7">Pācittiya&nbsp;7</a>)</p>

<p>Exhorting a bhikkhunī about the eight vows of respect — except when one has been authorized to do so by the Community or asked a question by a bhikkhunī — is a pācittiya offense. (<a href="../bmc/bmc1.8-3.html#pc21">Pācittiya&nbsp;21</a>)</p>

<h4>Right Livelihood</h4>

<p><a href="../mn/mn117.html#live">MN117</a> defines <i>wrong livelihood</i> as scheming, persuading, hinting, belittling, and pursuing gain with gain.</p>

<h4>General</h4>

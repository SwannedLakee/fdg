… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time, the group of six monks, quarrelling with well behaved monks, insulted the well behaved monks; they jeered at them, they scoffed at them about birth and name and clan and work and craft and disease and distinguishing mark and passion and attainment and low mode of address. Those who were modest monks looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying:</p>

<p>“How can this group of six monks, quarrelling with well behaved monks, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="Vin.4.5"></a>insult the well behaved monks? How can they jeer at them, scoff at them about birth … low mode of address?” Then these monks told this matter to the lord. He said:</p>

<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks, quarrelling with well behaved monks, insulted the well behaved monks, jeered at them … about low mode of address?”</p>

<p>“It is true, lord,” they said.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying: “How can you, foolish men, quarrelling with well behaved monks, insult the well behaved monks, jeer <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.172" href="#BD.2.172"></a>at them, scoff at them about … low mode of address? It is not, foolish men, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased …” And having rebuked them and given dhamma-talk, he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

<p>How can they revile and insult them about their caste, name, family, work, trade, illnesses, physical traits, defilements, and offences, and by calling them names?"</p>

<p>After criticising those monks in many ways, they informed the Master. … “Is it true, monks, that you treat good monks in this way?" “It’s true, Master."</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>The Buddha, the Master, criticised them: “ … Foolish men, how can you argue with and abuse good monks? How can you revile and insult them about their caste, name, family, work, trade, illnesses, physical traits, defilements, and offences, and by calling them names? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … " … and after criticising them … he spoke on the Dhamma and addressed the monks:</p>

<hr>
<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>“Once upon a time, monks, there was a brahman in Takkasilā who had an ox called Nandivisāla. On one occasion the ox said to the brahman: “Go, brahman, and make the following bet worth one thousand coins with the head merchant: ‘My ox will pull one hundred carts tied together.’" And that brahman did just that. Then, after tying one hundred carts together and yoking Nandivisāla to them, he said: “Go, you fraud; pull, you liar." But Nandivisāla just stood right there.</p>

<hr>
<p>Then that brahman became depressed because he had lost one thousand coins. And Nandivisāla said to him: “Why are you depressed?"</p>

<hr>
<p>“Because I lost one thousand coins because of you."</p>

<p>“But why did you disgrace me by calling me a fraud when I’m not? Now go, brahman, and make the same bet worth two thousand coins with the head merchant. But don’t disgrace me by calling me a fraud." Once again that brahman did just that. Then, after tying one hundred carts together and yoking Nandivisāla to them, he said: “Go, good ox; pull, good ox." And Nandivisāla pulled those one hundred carts.</p>

</div>

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>“Even at that time, monks, reviling and insulting was unpleasant to me. How then could reviling and insulting be pleasant now? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>

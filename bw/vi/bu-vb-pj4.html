<h3>Origin story</h3>
<h4>First sub-story</h4>
</div>

<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span><span class="ms">Bu-Pj.4, Bu-Pj.4.1, Bu-Pj.4.1.1, Bu-Pj.4.1.1, bd.1.151, pts_pn3.87, ms.534</span>At one time the Buddha, the Master, was staying near Vesālī in the Great Wood in the hall with the peaked roof. At that time a number of monks who were friends had entered the rains on the banks of the river Vaggumudā. Just then Vajjī was short of food and stricken by hunger, with crops blighted and turned to straw, and it was not easy to keep oneself going by collecting alms.</p>

<p>The monks considered the difficult circumstances, and they thought, "How can we remain united and in harmony, have a comfortable rains, and get almsfood without problems?"</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span><span class="ms">MS.535</span>Some said, "We could do work for the householders, and they will give something in return. In this way we will be united and in harmony, and we will spend the rains in comfort and have no problems getting almsfood."</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span><span class="ms">MS.536</span> Some said, "There is no need to do work for the householders. Let us instead take messages for them, <span class="ms">BD.1.152</span> and they will give something in return. In this way we will be united and in harmony, and we will spend the rains in comfort and have no problems getting almsfood."</p>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span><span class="ms">MS.537</span> Some said, "There is no need to do work for the householders, nor to take messages for them. Let us instead praise one another’s super-human achievements to the householders: ‘Such a monk has the first <i>jhāna</i>, such a monk the second <i>jhāna</i>, such a monk the third, such a monk the fourth; such a monk is stream-enterer, such a monk a once-returner, such a non-returner, such an <i>arahant</i>; such a monk has the three true knowledges, and such the six direct knowledges.’ And then they will give to us. In this way we will be united <span class="ms">Vin.3.88</span> and in harmony, and we will spend the rains in comfort and have no problems getting almsfood. Indeed, this is the better way, that we praise one another’s super-human achievements to the householders."</p>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span><span class="ms">MS.538</span> Then those monks praised one another’s super-human achievements to the householders: "Such a monk has the first <i>jhāna</i> … such a monk has the six direct knowledges." And those people thought: "We are fortunate that such monks have come to us for the rains. Such monks as these, who are virtuous <span class="ms">BD.1.153</span> and of good character, have never before entered the rains with us." And they gave such food and drink to those monks that they did not even eat and drink themselves, or give to their parents, to their wives and children, to their slaves, servants and workers, to their friends and companions, or to their relatives. In this way those monks were handsome, with rounded features, bright faces, and clear complexion.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span><span class="ms">Bu-Pj.4.1.2</span><span class="ms">MS.539</span> Now it was the custom for monks who had finished keeping the rains to go and see the Master. So when the rains was finished and the three months had elapsed, those monks put their lodging in order, took their bowls and robes, and departed for Vesālī. Walking by stages, they arrived at Vesālī and went to the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. There they approached the Master, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side.</p>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span><span class="ms">MS.540</span> At that time the monks who had spent the rains in that region were thin, <span class="ms">BD.1.154</span> haggard and pale, their veins protruding all over their limbs. But the monks from the banks of the Vaggumudā were handsome, with rounded features, bright faces, and clear complexion. It is the custom for Buddhas, for Masters, to greet visiting monks, and so the Master said to them: "I hope you are keeping well, monks, I hope you are comfortable; I hope you spent the rains at ease, in concord and harmony, without dispute, and that you had no trouble getting almsfood?"</p>

<p>"We are keeping well, Master, we are comfortable; we spent the rains at ease, in concord and harmony, without dispute, and we had no trouble getting almsfood."</p>

<p>Tathāgatas sometimes ask knowing, <span class="ms">Vin.3.89</span> and knowing sometimes do not ask … <span class="add">As in Expulsion 1, MS paragraph <span class="ref">20</span></span> … Buddhas, Masters, question the monks for two reasons, thinking, "We shall teach the Dhamma or lay down a training rule for the disciples."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>And the Master said to those monks: <span class="ms">MS.541</span>"In what way, monks, did you spent the rains at ease, without having any trouble getting almsfood?"</p>

<p>Then those monks informed the Master.</p>

<hr>
<p>"But had you really achieved those super-human achievements?"</p>

<hr>
<p>"No, Master."</p>

<hr>
<p>The Buddha, the Master, rebuked them: "It is unsuitable, foolish men, itʼs not becoming, <span class="ms">BD.1.155</span> itʼs not proper, itʼs not fitting for an ascetic, itʼs not allowable, itʼs not to be done. How could you for the sake of your stomachs praise one another’s super-human achievements to householders? It would be better for your bellies to be cut open with a sharp butcher’s knife than for you to praise one another’s super-human achievements to householders. Why is that? Because for that reason you might die or experience death-like suffering, but you would not because of that be reborn in a bad destination. But for <i>this</i> reason you might. This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … " … Having thus rebuked them and spoken on the Dhamma, he addressed the monks:</p>

<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span><span class="ms">Bu-Pj.4.1.3</span><span class="ms">MS.542</span> "Monks, there are these five great gangsters to be found in the world. What five? A certain great gangster thinks like this: ‘Oh when will I, with a following of a hundred or a thousand men, wander among villages, towns, and royal capitals, killing and making others kill, destroying and making others destroy, tormenting and making others torment,’ and after some time he does just that. Just so, monks, a certain bad monk thinks like this: ‘Oh when will I, with a following of a hundred or a thousand people, go on tour among villages, towns, and royal capitals, being honoured, respected, revered, and worshipped, by both householders and those <span class="ms">BD.1.156</span> gone forth, and obtain robes, almsfood, lodging, and medicines,’ and after some time he does <span class="ms">Vin.3.90</span> just that. This is the first great gangster to be found in the world.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span><span class="ms">MS.543</span>"Again, a certain bad monk learns the Dhamma and training proclaimed by the Tathāgata and takes it as his own. This is the second great gangster to be found in the world.</p>

<p id="p11"><span class="parno">11</span><span class="ms">MS.544</span>"Again, a certain bad monk groundlessly accuses someone who lives the spiritual life in purity of not being celibate. This is the third great gangster to be found in the world.</p>

<p id="p12"><span class="parno">12</span><span class="ms">MS.545</span>"Again, a certain bad monk takes valuable goods and requisites belonging to the Saṅgha—a monastery, the land of a monastery, a dwelling, the land for a dwelling, a bed, a bench, a cushion, a pillow, a brass vessel, a brass jar, a brass pot, a brass receptacle, an adze, a hatchet, an axe, a spade, a chisel, a creeper, bamboo, <i>muñja</i>-grass, <i>babbaja</i>-grass, <i>tiṇa</i>-grass, clay, wooden articles, earthenware articles—and uses these to win over and create a following among householders. This is the fourth great gangster to be found in the world.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p13"><span class="parno">13</span><span class="ms">BD.1.157, MS.546</span> "But in this world with its gods, its lords of death, and its supreme beings, among this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans, this the greatest gangster: he who untruthfully and groundlessly boasts about a super-human achievement. Why is that? Monks, you have eaten the country’s almsfood by theft."</p>

<p id="p14" class="verse"><span class="parno">14</span><span class="ms">MS.547</span>Whoever should declare himself
<br>to be other than he truly is,
<br>Has eaten this by theft,
<br>like a cheater who has deceived.</p>

<p id="p15" class="verse"><span class="parno">15</span><span class="ms">MS.548</span>Many yellow-necks of bad qualities,
<br>uncontrolled and
<br>Wicked, by their wicked deeds,
<br>in hell they are reborn.</p>

<p id="p16" class="verse"><span class="parno">16</span><span class="ms">MS.549</span>Better to eat an iron ball
<br>heated like a blazing fire,
<br>Than for the immoral and uncontrolled
<br>to eat the country’s alms.</p>

<p id="p17"><span class="parno">17</span><span class="ms">MS.550</span>Then the Master, having rebuked the monks from the banks of the Vaggumudā in various ways for being difficult to maintain, difficult to support … " … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>

<h4>Preliminary ruling</h4>

<p id="p18"><span class="parno">18</span><span class="ms">MS.551</span><span class="rule">"If a monk falsely claims for himself a super-human achievement, knowledge <span class="ms">BD.1.158</span> and vision worthy of the noble ones, saying, ‘This I know, this I see,’ but after some time—whether questioned or not, but having committed the offence and desiring purification—should say, ‘Not knowing I said that I know, <span class="ms">Vin.3.91</span> not seeing that I see; what I said was empty and false,’ he too is expelled and not in communion."</span></p>

<p id="p19"><span class="parno">19</span><span class="ms">MS.552</span>In this way the Master laid down this training rule for the monks.</p>

<h4>Second sub-story</h4>

<p id="p20"><span class="parno">20</span><span class="ms">Bu-Pj.4.2, MS.553</span> At one time a number of monks, thinking they had seen what they had not, attained what they had not, achieved what they had not, realised what they had not, declared final knowledge based on overestimation. After some time their minds inclined to sense desire, anger, and confusion. They became anxious, thinking, "The Master has laid down a training rule; yet we … declared final knowledge based on overestimation. Could it be that we have fallen into an offence entailing expulsion? They informed Venerable Ānanda, who informed the Master. He said: "Ānanda, these monks declared final knowledge <span class="ms">BD.1.159</span> based on overestimation, thinking they had seen what they had not … but this is negligible. <span class="ms">MS.554</span></p>

<p id="p21"><span class="parno">21</span>And so, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>

<h3>Final ruling</h3>

<p id="p22"><span class="parno">22</span><span class="ms">MS.555</span><span class="rule">"If a monk falsely claims for himself a super-human achievement, knowledge and insight worthy of the noble ones, saying, ‘This I know, this I see,’ but after some time—whether questioned or not, but having committed the offence and desiring purification—should say, ‘Not knowing I said that I know, not seeing that I see; what I said was empty and false,’ except if it is through overestimation, he too is expelled and not in communion."</span></p>

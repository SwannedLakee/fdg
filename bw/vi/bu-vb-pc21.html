<h3>Origin story</h3>
<h4>First sub-story</h4>
</div>

<p><span class="parno">1. Bu-Pc.21.1, BD.2.263</span>At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. At that time the senior monks who instructed the nuns were receiving robes, almsfood, lodging requisites, and medicines. When they knew that this was happening, some monks from the group of six thought: “Well then, let’s instruct the nuns." They then went to the nuns and said: “Sisters, come to us and we will instruct you too."</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>Soon afterwards those nuns went to those monks from the group of six, paid homage to them, and sat down to one side. Then, after speaking just a little bit of Dhamma, those monks spent the day on pointless talk, before dismissing the nuns: “Go, sisters."</p>

<p>Those nuns then went to the Master, paid homage to him, and stood to one side. And the Master said to them: “Nuns, I hope the instruction was effective?"</p>

<p>“Bhante, how could the instruction be effective? After speaking just a little bit of Dhamma, those monks from the group of six spent the day on pointless talk, and then dismissed us."</p>

<p>The Master then instructed, inspired, and gladdened those nuns with a Dhamma talk. The nuns paid homage to the Master, circumambulated him with their right side towards him, and departed.</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>Then the Master convened the Saṅgha and questioned those monks from the group of six: “Is it true, monks, that you do this?" “Itʼs true, Master." The Buddha, the Master, rebuked them … “Foolish men, how can you speak just a little bit of Dhamma to the nuns, and then spend the day on pointless talk, before dismissing them? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … " … and after criticising them … he spoke on the Dhamma and addressed the monks: “Monks, I allow you to choose an instructor for the nuns. And this is how he should be chosen. First a monk should be asked and then an experienced and competent monk should inform the Saṅgha:</p>

<hr>
<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>“‘Bhante, let the Saṅgha listen to me. If it seems appropriate to the Saṅgha, it should choose monk so-and-so as an instructor of the nuns. This is the motion.</p>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>“‘Bhante, let the Saṅgha listen to me. The Saṅgha chooses monk so-and-so as an instructor of the nuns. Any monk who agrees to choosing monk so-and-so as an instructor of the nuns should remain silent. Any monk who does not agree should say so.</p>

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>“‘For a second time I speak on this matter … For a third time I speak on this matter: Bhante, let the Saṅgha listen to me. The Saṅgha chooses monk so-and-so as an instructor of the nuns. Any monk who agrees to choosing monk so-and-so as an instructor of the nuns should remain silent. Any monk who does not agree should say so.</p>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>“‘The Saṅgha has chosen monks so-and-so as an instructor of the nuns. The Saṅgha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’"</p>

<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>Then, after rebuking those monks from the group of six in many ways for being difficult to support … the Master said: “And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>

<h3>Final ruling</h3>

<p class="rule"><span class="parno">9</span>“If a monk who has not been agreed upon instructs the nuns, he commits an offence entailing confession."</p>

<p id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>In this way the Master laid down this training rule for the monks.</p>

<h4>Second sub-story</h4>

<p id="p11"><span class="parno">11</span>After being chosen to do so, the senior monks who instructed the nuns still received robes, almsfood, lodging requisites, and medicines. When they knew this was the case, monks from the group of six said: “Well then, let’s go outside the boundary, choose each other as instructors of the nuns, and then instruct them." After doing just that, they again went to the nuns and said: “Sisters, we too have been chosen. Come to us and we will instruct you too."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p12"><span class="parno">12</span>Once again the nuns went to those monks from the group of six and everything unfolded as before.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p13"><span class="parno">13</span>The Master then convened the Saṅgha and questioned those monks from the group of six: “Is it true, monks, that you are acting in this way?" “Itʼs true, Master." The Buddha, the Master, rebuked them … “Foolish men, how can you speak just a little bit of Dhamma to the nuns, and then spend the day on pointless talk, before dismissing them?" This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … " … and after criticising them … he spoke on the Dhamma and addressed the monks: “Monks, I allow you to choose a monk who possesses eight qualities as an instructor of the nuns:</p>

<hr>
<p>(1) “He is virtuous and restrained by the <i>pātimokkha</i>. His conduct is good, he associates with the right people, and he sees danger in minor faults. And he undertakes and trains in the training rules.</p>

<p>(2) “He has learned much, and he retains and accumulates what he has heard. Those teachings that are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, that have the right meaning and phrasing and which proclaim the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life—he has learned much of such teachings, retained them in mind, recited them verbally, mentally investigated them, and penetrated them well by view.</p>

<p>(3) “He has properly learned both <i>pātimokkhas</i> in detail, well analysed them, thoroughly mastered them, well investigated them in terms of the rules and their detailed exposition.</p>

<hr>
<p>(4) “He is a good speaker and has a good voice.</p>

<p>(5) “He is generally liked by and pleasing to the nuns.</p>

<p>(6) “He is able to instruct the nuns.</p>

<p>(7) “He has never committed a serious offence against a Buddhist nun.</p>

<hr>
<p>(8) “He has been fully ordained for at least twenty years.</p>

<p>“<span class="rule">Monks, I allow you to choose a monk who possesses these eight qualities as an instructor of the nuns.</span>"</p>

<h3>Definitions</h3>

<p id="p14"><span class="parno">14</span>A: whoever … Monk: … The monk who is ordained by a complete Saṅgha through a procedure of one motion and three announcements, which is unchallengeable and fit to stand; this sort of monk is meant in this case.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p15"><span class="parno">15</span>Who has not been agreed upon: who has not been agreed upon through an act consisting of one motion and three announcements.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p16"><span class="parno">16</span>Nuns: fully ordained by both Sanghas.</p>

<p id="p17"><span class="parno">17</span>Instructs: If he instructs about the eight important rules, he commits an offence entailing confession. If he instructs in any other teaching, he commits an offence of bad conduct. If he instructs a nun ordained only on one side, he commits an offence of bad conduct.</p>

<p id="p18"><span class="parno">18</span>The monk who has been agreed upon should sweep the surrounding area, set out water for drinking and for washing the feet, prepare a seat, get hold of a companion, and then sit down. The nuns should go there, pay homage to the monk, and sit down to one side. The monk should then ask them: “Sisters, are you all present?"</p>

<p>If they say: “We are all present, venerable," he should say: “Are you keeping the eight important rules?"</p>

<p>If they say: “We are," he should reply: “This is the instruction."</p>

<p>If they say: “We are not," he should recite them:</p>

<hr>
<p>(1) “A nun who has been ordained for a hundred years should pay homage to a monk who was ordained on that very day, and she should stand up for him, put the palms of her hands together for him, and act appropriately towards him. This rule is to be honoured and respected all one’s life, and is not to be broken.</p>

<p>(2) “A nun should not spend the rainy season in a monastery where there are no monks. This rule too is to be honoured and respected all one’s life, and is not to be broken.</p>

<p>(3) “Every fortnight a nun should ask the Saṅgha of monks for two things: about the date of the <i>uposatha</i> and about going for the instruction. This rule too is to be honoured and respected all one’s life, and is not to be broken.</p>

<p>(4) “A nun who has completed the rainy season should invite admonishment from both Sanghas in regard to three things: what has been seen, what has been heard, and what has been suspected. This rule too is to be honoured and respected all one’s life, and is not to be broken.</p>

<p>(5) “A nun who has committed a serious offence should practice deference towards both Sanghas for a fortnight. This rule too is to be honoured and respected all one’s life, and is not to be broken.</p>

<p>(6) “A trainee nun who has trained in the six rules for two years may seek for full ordination in both Sanghas. This rule too is to be honoured and respected all one’s life, and is not to be broken.</p>

<p>(7) “A nun may not in any way abuse or revile a monk. This rule too is to be honoured and respected all one’s life, and is not to be broken.</p>

<p>(8) “From today onwards, nuns may not correct monks, but monks may correct nuns. This rule too is to be honoured and respected all one’s life, and is not to be broken."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p19"><span class="parno">19</span>If they say: “We are all present, venerable," and he instructs them with another teaching, then he commits an offence of bad conduct. If they say: “We are not all present, venerable," and he instructs them about the eight important rules, then he commits an offence of bad conduct. If he does not give the instruction, but he gives them another teaching, then he commits an offence of bad conduct.</p>

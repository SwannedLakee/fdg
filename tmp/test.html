        <style id  = styling here, for better user experience.  You will see in the end of this webpage that we're
using a function to get our text based on browser language setting and display it appropriately with English by
default if no suitable phrase found as fallback option or else Russian version is used when available otherwise
english one gets displayed>

   body {  background-color: lavender; padding :10px ; }     //background color for the page. You can change this
to anything you like, it's just a design choice here    greetingSpan = document .createElement ('span') ,//create
span element where our text will be inserted into
document body ’> appendChild(greetings (browser language))   //insert above line of code inside the paragraph.
This is how you are doing it using pure JavaScript as there's no need for a server-side scripting to get browser
locale info and display this on client side with just HTML/JS

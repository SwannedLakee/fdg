    <h2>Specifics of Literal, Word-for-Word Translations. Pali–Russian</h2>
    <h5>Principles and policies applied in cases of “transl. o” – the text is fully translated from Pali, or “ed. o” – a fragment of the text is modified in accordance with the Pali original.</h5>

            <h4>Problem of Contextual Translation</h4>
            <p>Contextual translation was a reasonable path of least resistance for initial translations—especially when no Russian translations existed, or while translating directly from Pali to Russian. However, this approach causes various issues, including some fundamental problems.</p>
            <p><strong>Exaggerated example:</strong> In an imagined text, word X is translated as "parsley"; in another, it becomes "crossbow." As a result, the original meaning (e.g., "bow") is lost or obscured.</p>
            <p><strong>Real Example 1 from translations:</strong><br><code>anicc-<strong>ucchādana-parimaddana</strong>-bhedanaviddhaṁsanadhammassa</code><br>"...the body... subject to impermanence, <strong>deformation and abrasion</strong>, decay and dispersion."
            <br>And a second usage:<br><code><strong>ucchādana-parimaddana</strong>-nhāpanasambāhanaṁ</code><br>"But he consents to being <strong>rubbed, massaged</strong>, bathed, anointed."
            <p>"<code>ucchādana</code>" (rendered as deformation and rubbing) could have been validated and clarified in meaning, instead of ending up with conflicting uses. The same applies to <code>parimaddana</code> (abrasion/massage) — a more general term like kneading could have been used consistently.</p>
            <p><strong>Real Example 2, fundamental issue:</strong><br>
            <code>dukkha</code> — sometimes translated as pain, sometimes as suffering — led to a shift in emphasis. The cause (pain) became secondary, while the consequence (suffering) was emphasized as the main target for liberation.</p>
            <p>This happens despite the fact that dukkha is clearly defined in the suttas:<br>
            <code>Katamañcāvuso, dukkhaṁ?<br>
            Yaṁ kho, āvuso, kāyikaṁ dukkhaṁ kāyikaṁ asātaṁ kāyasamphassajaṁ dukkhaṁ asātaṁ vedayitaṁ,<br>
            idaṁ vuccatāvuso: ‘dukkhaṁ’.</code>
            <br>“And what, friends, is pain? It is bodily pain, bodily discomfort, pain born of bodily contact — this is called pain.”</p>
            <p><code>Katamañcāvuso, domanassaṁ? Yaṁ kho, āvuso, cetasikaṁ dukkhaṁ cetasikaṁ asātaṁ manosamphassajaḝ dukkhaṁ asātaṁ vedayitaḝ, idaṁ vuccatāvuso: ‘domanassaṁ’.</code>
            <br>“And what, friends, is mental suffering (domanassa)? It is mental pain, mental discomfort, pain born of mental contact — this is called domanassa.”</p>
            <p>Nowhere in the Suttas or the Vinaya is dukkha defined as "suffering." In fact, the term "suffering" (domanassa) is explicitly defined in terms of mental dukkha.</p>
            <p>In modern language, the term “pain” better fits both literal and metaphorical contexts than “suffering.” For example: “This issue has been a long-standing pain for me.” It retains the priority of direct sensation over reactive interpretation.</p>

            <h4>Cross-Validation Through Consistent Terminology</h4>
            <p>Aside from consistency, the Dhamma also demonstrates cross-verifiability and unidirectionality. The speech of a Tathāgata is not double-tongued or contradictory (<a href="/r/?s=dvayag%C4%81min%C4%AB&q=dn24#1.18.1">dvayagāminī</a>), and Dhamma should be well-expressed (<a href="/r/?q=an3.70#7.4">svākkhāto</a>).</p>
            <p>Example: Dukkha is defined in MN141, DN22, etc., as bodily pain/discomfort. Nowhere is it defined as "suffering."</p>
            <p>In the Four Noble Truths:<br>
            <code>soka-parideva-dukkha-domanass-upāyāsa</code> — Dukkha and domanassa are defined as bodily and mental pain/discomfort respectively, with bodily listed first.</p>
            <p>In Satipaṭṭhānas: <code>kāyo, vedanā</code> (body, feeling) come before <code>citta</code> (mind-state).</p>
            <p>In the six dhatus: four great elements are bodily; viññāṅadhātu is mental or "producing mentality."</p>
            <p>In five aggregates: <code>rūpa, vedanā, saññā, saṅkhārā, viññāṅa</code> — feeling comes before mental phenomena.</p>
            <p>In six internal bases: <code>cakkhu, sota, ghāna, jivhā, kāyo, mano</code> — the body precedes mind.</p>
            <p>In Dependent Origination: Ignorance is defined as ignorance of dukkha, etc. Sankhāras: bodily, verbal, mental (body first). Viññāṅa has six types; <code>kāyo, mano</code> again — body before mind.</p>
            <p>In kamma (action): body, speech, mind — again, body comes first.</p>
            <p>This shows a clear prioritization of physical pain/discomfort (dukkha) over reactive emotional suffering (domanassa).</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h4>The Problem of Sanskrit-Centrism</h4>
            <p>Sanskrit-centrism (pan-Sanskritism) is considered a non-optimal approach for understanding the Buddha's Teaching. The Teaching exists in its full form in Pali, not Sanskrit. Chronologically, it was first formulated in Pali. Equating the conceptual base of Pali-Dhamma with that of Sanskrit-Hindu sacred texts is hasty and misleading.</p>
            <p>Even within one tradition, doctrinal terms can differ vastly. Assuming two entire languages with centuries of diverging lineages would share identical terminology is overly simplistic.</p>
            <p>The well-known contrast between <code>atta</code> (essence, autonomy, everyday "self") and <code>ātman</code> (higher Self) illustrates this gap clearly.</p>
            <p><strong>Examples of terminological divergence:</strong><br>
            <code>dukkha, taṃhā/tasinā, kāma, kamma</code> — while sometimes translated as "suffering," "craving," "sensual desire," and "action" respectively in Sanskrit traditions, these meanings do not hold in Pali texts when definitions are taken strictly from the canon.</p>
            <p>Example: <code>taṃhā</code> is not equivalent to "thirst" (<code>tṛṣṇā</code>) as found in Sanskrit. Instead, <code>taṃhā</code> is accompanied by delight and passion, not dryness or depletion. The term <code>tasinā</code>, not <code>taṃhā</code>, appears in desert metaphors and heat-induced distress.</p>
            <p>Example: <code>kāma</code> in Pali refers broadly to desire, not only to sensual pleasures. Even the Buddha is described using <code>atthakāma, hitakāma</code> — desiring benefit and welfare (MN19).</p>
            <p>Example: <code>kamma</code> includes refined mental qualities such as right view and right concentration (AN4.237, AN4.238), not merely gross physical acts.</p>
            <p>Thus, Pali terms differ significantly from both their Sanskrit "cognates" and conventional Buddhist translations. Sanskrit may be consulted only when Pali lacks context, and only if no contradictions arise.</p>

        <p><a id="ast1" href="#ast1Back">1*</a> Contextual translation means using different words for the same Pali term. Systematic translation implies analyzing all sutta and Vinaya occurrences to identify one term or a consistent cluster (preferably related and clarifying).</p>

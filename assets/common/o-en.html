    <h2>Specifics of Literal, Word-for-Word Translations. Pali-English</h2>
    <h5>Principles and approaches applied in cases of "translation o" - text fully translated from Pali, or "ed. o" - text fragment modified according to the Pali original.</h5>
    
    <ol>
        <li>
            Any translation from Pali or translation of another author's translation, whether it's a complete text, text fragment, dictionary entry, topical article, or simply a term translation, in digital, printed, or oral form, as of today (<span id="date"></span>) is not considered final but is regarded as <strong>"Work in Progress"</strong> in preparation.  
            To obtain a final translation, meanings and terms must be correctly established.  
            If such a translation is possible, it can only be done by an Arahant with the four "analytical knowledges"  
            (<a href="/r/?s=pa%E1%B9%ADisambhid&q=an4.172#0.3">catasso paṭisambhidā</a>).
        </li>
        
        <script>
            const now = new Date();
            const formattedDate = String(now.getDate()).padStart(2, '0') + '-' +
                                String(now.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0') + '-' +
                                now.getFullYear();
            document.getElementById("date").textContent = formattedDate;
        </script>
        
        <li>Terminology in the Buddha's Teaching must be <strong>consistent</strong>, this is an integral part of any adequate instructions and documents, not to mention the Supreme Teacher and Supreme Teaching describing the most subtle, fundamental principles of the universe's workings and methods of its realization. Dhamma is <strong>not</strong> fiction. Meanings and definitions are uniform across all texts, especially those concerning the Four Noble Truths and adjacent layers of text. More details in <a href="#additional">"Additional Information"</a></li>   
        <li>If a concept has a definition in the suttas, that meaning is applied. Example: dukkha has definitions in the suttas. "Pain (dukkha) is bodily pain, bodily discomfort..." (Sutta "Analysis of Truths" <a href="/r/?q=mn141&s=dukkha&lang=pli-rus#16.1">mn141</a>) also in <a href="#additional">"Additional Information"</a>. Ignoring direct term definitions from suttas is considered unprofessional, conformist approach and renders the entire Buddha's Teaching as not well-formulated (not svākkhāto).</li>
        <li>If a definition cannot be found in the suttas but can be found in the Vinaya Vibhaṅga (hereinafter Vinaya), that meaning is applied.</li>
        <li>
            If a word's definition is found neither in the suttas nor in the Vinaya, then a systemic translation is preferred over a contextual one<a id="ast1Back" href="#ast1">*</a>. That is, ideally one word that maximally covers all usage contexts in all or most cases of its occurrence in the suttas and Vinaya. More about contextual translation issues in <a href="#additional">"Additional Information"</a>.
        </li>
        <li>If a word occurs too rarely or in monotonous cases, and it has no definition in the suttas and Vinaya, then a contextual or dictionary meaning is used.</li>     
        <li>
            If a generally accepted translation or interpretation, including from a commentary or sub-commentary of any concept, contradicts the above points — such translation or interpretation are not applied.
        </li>  
        
        <li>
            If a Pali concept is broader than a single concept in English, then a word cluster or a separate word from the cluster is used. Example: rāga — passion-enchantment, anicca — unreliability, instability, untrustworthiness, "impermanence". Such a cluster may be used at the first occurrence of the word in the text, further in the text only one key word is used. As if it were written: passion-enchantment (hereinafter passion). Or jhāyatha - ignite (ardently strive, concentrate, "meditate", contemplate), further ignite.
        </li>        
        <li>
            If a Pali concept is more specific, while the English concept is broader, then a clarification is used. Example: ceto — mind-thinking, citta — mind-state, mano — mind-representation. As if it were written: mind-state (hereinafter mind).
        </li>                
        <li>Preserving the word order in the Pali sentence is preferred.</li>
        <li>Preserving Pali grammar is preferred.</li>   
    </ol>

    <h4>Issues with Contextual Translation</h4>
    <p>
    Contextual translation was an appropriate path of least resistance for primary text translations when there were no English translations at all or in the process of creating translations directly from Pali to English, but as a result, a number of problems arose, including fundamental ones.</p>

    <p><strong>Exaggerated example:</strong></p>

    <p>In an imaginary text - word X is translated as citrus, in another word X is translated as tamgerine color. Contextual translation led to the word "orange" losing both its meanings, or acquiring additional unnecessary connotations.</p>

    <p><strong>Example 1 from translations:</strong></p>

    <p><code>anicc-<strong>ucchādana-parimaddana</strong>-bhedanaviddhaṁsanadhammassa</code><br>
    ...body... subject to impermanence, <strong>deformation and abrasion</strong>, disintegration and dispersion.</p>

    <p>And the second case:<br>
    <code><strong>ucchādana-parimaddana</strong>-nhāpanasambāhanaṁ</code><br>
    "But he agrees to have them <strong>rub, massage</strong>, bathe, knead him."</p>

    <p><code>ucchādana</code> (translated as deformation and rubbing) as in the example with the word "bow" the word covering (as smearing, covering, including as concealment for the case with unreliability and disintegration) acquired an inappropriate meaning, although it could have been verified and clarified.</p>

    <p><code>parimaddana</code> (abrasion, massage) - instead of a general word, for example, kneading (when something is crumpled).</p>

    <p><strong>Example 2 fundamental problem</strong><br>
    <code>dukkha</code> - translated sometimes as pain, sometimes as suffering<a id="ast3Back" href="#ast3">*</a>, led to the cause (pain) becoming less important, and the consequence (suffering) becoming the main goal of Liberation.</p>

<p>The fact that the definition of dukkha exists in the Suttas is ignored everywhere, not only in English translations.
<a href="/r/?q=dn22&s=dukkha#18.18">dn22</a> - definitions of the concept in the practical realization of the four noble truths, <a href="/r/?q=mn141&s=dukkha#16.1">mn141</a> - definition of the concept in the four noble truths. </p>

<p><code>Katamañcāvuso, dukkhaṁ? 
Yaṁ kho, āvuso, kāyikaṁ dukkhaṁ kāyikaṁ asātaṁ kāyasamphassajaṁ dukkhaṁ asātaṁ vedayitaṁ, 
idaṁ vuccatāvuso: ‘dukkhaṁ’.</code><br> 

And what, friends, is pain?
That which, friends, is bodily pain, bodily discomfort, born of bodily contact, pain, discomfort felt, 
This is called, friends, "pain".

<br> 
<code>Katamañcāvuso, domanassaṁ? 
Yaṁ kho, āvuso, cetasikaṁ dukkhaṁ cetasikaṁ asātaṁ manosamphassajaṁ dukkhaṁ asātaṁ vedayitaṁ, 
idaṁ vuccatāvuso: ‘domanassaṁ’.</code>

<br>  
And what, friends, is "suffering" (discontent, dissatisfaction)?
That which, friends, is mental pain, mental discomfort, born of mental contact, pain, discomfort felt, 
This is called, friends, "suffering".

</p>

  <p>There is no definition of dukkha (pain) as "suffering" in the Suttas or Vinaya, on the contrary "suffering" (domanassa) is defined through the concept of "mental" pain (dukkha).</p>

 <p>But in the case of bodily pain-discomfort, contextual translation wasn't even needed. Since the word "pain" already has a meaning and even more suitable than "suffering". In a figurative sense, "pain" is a problem, something that requires a solution, without the hyperbolic "loudness" of the word "suffering". Example: This issue is my long-standing pain. Thus, the word "pain" covers all necessary contexts and preserves the priority of bodily sensation over the reaction to this sensation or experience (more on this below).</p>
</li>


<li>
    <h4>Cross-Verifiability of Consistent Terminology</h4>
    <p>In addition to consistent terminology in the Buddha's Teaching, cross-verifiability and unidirectionality are easily traceable, preserving many principles including that the Tathagata's speech cannot be ambiguously contradictory <a href="/r/?s=dvayag%C4%81min%C4%AB&q=dn24#1.18.1">dvayagāmini</a>, and on the contrary, that the Dhamma should be well-formulated <a href="/r/?q=an3.70#7.4">svākkhāto</a>.</p>

    <p>Example: dukkha is defined in mn141, dn22 and other suttas as bodily pain, bodily discomfort. There is no definition of dukkha as "suffering" in the Suttas or Vinaya - this is merely the result of contextual "translation".</p>

    <p>In the 4 noble truths:<br>
    <code>soka-parideva-dukkha-domanass-upāyāsa</code><br>

    <p>dukkha domanassa - two direct definitions: bodily and mental pain and discomfort respectively. bodily comes before mental.</p>

    <p>In satipatthanas:<br>
    <code>kāyo vedana</code> - the first two parts of satipatthana, <code>citta</code> - mind-state third</p>

    <p>In 6 dhatus (4 great elements + 2 dhatus):<br>
    4 great elements are all "bodily" (mn28) viññāṇadhatu ~mental or more precisely phenomenon producing mentality.</p>

    <p>In 5 aggregates of clinging:<br>
    <code>rūpa vedana sañña saṅkhārā viññāṇa</code> - ~matter, feeling of pleasant, pain, neither-pain-nor-pleasant, and only then come ~mental phenomena.</p>

    <p>In 6 internal bases:<br>
    <code>cakkhu soto ghāna jivha kāyo mano</code> - body is placed before mind-representation.</p>

    <p>In dependent origination (<a href="https://dhamma.gift/r/?q=sn12.2#14.2">sn12.2</a>):<br>
    avijjā - has a precise definition: not knowing about pain (dukkha) etc.<br>
    in definition of sankharas: body, speech, mind (body first)<br>
    viññāṇa - 6 types <code>kāyo mano</code> - body comes before mind.<br>

<code>nāma-rūpa</code> name-~matter<br> 
name is <code>vedanā, saññā, cetanā, phasso, manasikāro</code>
 feeling, perception, volition, contact, attention. <br>
    vedana comes first before more ~mental phenomena such as for example cetana and manasikara.<br>
    in other condition sequences where body and mind can be distinguished the same principle as with viññāṇa - body or contact comes before mind or phenomenon (Dhamma).</p>

    <p>In types of activity (kamma): body, speech, mind (body first)</p>

    <p>Based on this principle, it can be understood that bodily pain-discomfort always had first priority, even indirectly, not to mention direct definitions, while "suffering, dissatisfaction" as a reaction or opinion about what is happening on the contrary was never a priority.</p>
</li>

<li>
    <h4>Issues with Sanskritocentrism</h4>

    <p>Sanskritocentrism (pan-Sanskritism)<a id="ast2Back" href="#ast2">*</a> is considered a non-optimal approach for understanding the Buddha's Teaching. The Buddha's Teaching in exhaustive completeness exists in Pali, but not in Sanskrit. Also chronologically it was formulated in Pali earlier. To assume that the conceptual base of Pali - Dhamma and Sanskrit - Hindu base of sacred texts is identical is rash. </p>

    <p>Even within one teaching, one religion, divergences in meanings of concepts are so great that separate, sometimes hostile, movements, schools, sects are formed. But at the same time, it is assumed that two languages containing the heritage and burden of many dozens of teachings, schools and many hundreds of sects will coincide down to subtleties and nuances. </p>

<p> Also the imaginary absence of false cognates and "false friends of the translator" between the two languages can serve as a good illustration of the unconvincingness of the pro-Sanskrit approach to Pali. As if someone made an illogical equation: "if languages have similar grammar and many related words, then the key concepts of teachings are also identical".</p> 

    <p>Atta and Atman serve as a vivid example of obviously existing divergences and non-interchangeability of meanings. Atta (essence, selfhood, ~autonomy, bypassed "I") Pali and Atman (higher "Self") Sanskrit. </p>

    <p><strong>Examples of terminological divergences:</strong></p>
    <p><code>duḥkha</code>, <code>tṛṣṇā</code>, <code>kāma</code> and <code>karma</code>, possibly in some cases are "suffering", "craving", "sensual desire" and "action" within some teaching recorded in Sanskrit. But in Pali, if primarily for establishing terms Pali texts were taken into account, not parallels between two languages, this would be unlikely.</p>

    <p><strong>Examples from Pali texts:</strong></p>
    
    <p>1. <code>dukkha</code>:
    <ul>
        <li><a href="/r/?q=dn22&s=dukkha#18.18">dn22</a> - definitions of the concept in the practical realization of the four noble truths</li>
        <li><a href="/r/?q=mn141&s=dukkha#16.1">mn141</a> - definitions of the concept in the four noble truths. 
<br> 

    <code>soka-parideva-dukkha-domanass-upāyāsa</code><br>

  Suffering [meaning 1], lamentation, pain, "suffering" [meaning 2], despair</p>

If we talk about suffering, then in the direct sense it is either soko - very strong bodily and mental pain, in which the experiencer:<br>

<code><strong>socati</strong> kilamati paridevati, urattāḷiṁ kandati, sammohaṁ āpajjati</code><br>
suffers, languishes, cries, beats-breast-weeps, falls into confusion.  
<br>
or domanassa in the figurative meaning of "suffering", as mental pain.
</p>

</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>2. <code>taṇhā</code>:
    <ul>
        <li><p>Two Pali terms — taṇhā and tasinā<a id="ast4Back" href="#ast4">*</a> — quite mechanically, without considering the context of usage in the Suttas, were attributed full synonymous meaning between themselves and with the Sanskrit tṛṣṇā. The latter is explained by standard phonetic mutation: tṛṣṇā → taṇhā (there are only about three such words in the entire core of original Pali texts kṛṣṇa → kaṇha, uṣṇa → uṇha). Although it would seem tṛṣṇā is easier to transform into tasinā (tṛ → t, ṣ → s, ṇā → nā), rather than into taṇhā.

        But in any case, phonetic mutation cannot be a guarantee that the meanings of words are also "transferred", especially since as a result of "mutation" of one word both "receive" completely identical meanings.

</p>

<p>
            Exaggerated example: as if it were said the following: here is the word "hot" in language Z, - it is a complete synonym of two words from language X "hot dish" and "fire", therefore both words in language X are complete synonyms.
            <br>
        
            <!--<br> 
            <br>If adapting the example to tṛṣṇā and taṇhā with tasinā:
            Suppose in Sanskrit it is "desire" (moderate, even acceptable as "thirst for travel"), in Pali "wanting" (weaker than desire) and "thirst" (real in both direct and figurative senses). Can these three words be equated and said to be the same?  --> 

        </p>
<p>
        Divergences in meaning and usage of Pali taṇhā and tasinā between themselves are quite easily traceable in the texts below. taṇhā is used where the phenomenon is associated with joy and passion-enchantment, which delights here-and-there, but tasinā is used in cases with desert, heat and exhaustion in more extreme circumstances.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="/r/?q=sn56.11&s=ta%E1%B9%87h%C4%81#4.4">sn56.11</a> - if taṇhā were thirst, here standard translation as "craving" will not be used as it is even heavier meaning and word than "thirst" in English. So thirst should be either an unpleasant experience of dryness and dehydration, or a strong often passionate striving, need, weaker but still a craving, very focused on the result (thirst for life - to preserve life and its quality at any cost, thirst for knowledge - desire to obtain information or experience without paying attention to other benefits).</p> 

    <p>But in the definition of the Second Noble Truth it is stated that 'taṇhā' <strong>is accompanied</strong> sahagata literally Pali "goes together" with joy-pleasure and passion-enchantment. Not "pursues joy and passion" - as in case of their lack or "connected with them" - as a potential outcome upon their obtaining, but, as if they were already present in the current experience. Judging by the metaphors with one exhausted from heat and thirst, tasinā would be more appropriate in such a case.</p>

<p>Delighting here-and-there. tatratatrābhinandinī, ~now this, now that delighting - this is not an attribute of strong one-directional, result-focused "thirst" from the English language. Gathering these details together, it would be more appropriate to use the word "wanting" (as moderate even pleasant wanting, fancy for something) for taṇhā. But in any case both thirst and wanting lead to pleonasm in case of kama-tanha - desire of desires and in many cases given below. Also below and that kama is not sensual desire, but desire in general.</p>


<!-- <a id="ast5Back" href="#ast5">*</a> -->
        </li>
        <li><a href="/r/?q=sn12.68&s=tasito">sn12.68</a> - circumstances suitable for real strong "thirst" are described and here a derivative word from tasinā is used, not taṇhā, but if this is a phenomenon related to desire to drink, then there would be pleonasm with pipāsito: thirsty, desiring to drink. in any case, in such a context does not fit "accompanied by joy-passion, here-and-there delighting", which is said many times about ta</li>
        <li><a href="/r/?q=snp3.2&s=ta%E1%B9%87h%C4%81#12.3">snp3.2</a> - same case taṇhā is not used, instead tasina, and same tautology with pipāsā</li>
        <li><a href="/r/?q=an4.10&s=ta%E1%B9%87h#1.6">an4.10</a> - also not taṇhā, but tasina, and tautology with pipāsā</li>
        <li><a href="/r/?q=an4.184&s=ta%E1%B9%87h#3.2">an4.184</a> - also taṇho - if it is thirst, then there would be tautology with pipāso, moreover here clearly pipāso has figurative meaning, but when this word is used in direct meaning - it means "desire to drink".</li>
        <li><a href="/r/?q=an3.76&s=ta%E1%B9%87h#2.3">an3.76</a> - if taṇho - is thirst, then here misleading oxymoron: thirst as moisture and nourishment</li>
        <li><a href="/r/?q=an3.76&s=ta%E1%B9%87h#2.3">an3.77</a> - same as in previous sutta</li>
        <li><a href="/r/?q=sn44.9&s=ta%E1%B9%87h#6.6">sn44.9</a> - logical contradiction: thirst (hunger for liquid) as nourishment</li>
        <li><a href="/r/?q=an10.62&s=ta%E1%B9%87h#2.2">an10.62</a> - what is the nourishment of thirst? Thirst is absence, not nourishment itself</li>
        <li><a href="/r/?q=iti109&s=ta%E1%B9%87h#3.3">iti109</a> - river's flow is thirst. State of water absence is water flow.</li>
        <li><a href="/r/?q=sn41.5&s=ta%E1%B9%87h#5.10">sn41.5</a> - similar contradiction with water flow</li>
        <li><a href="/r/?q=mn9&s=ta%E1%B9%87h%C4%81#11.5">mn9</a> - from accumulation of thirst - accumulation of nourishment (logically should be opposite. from disappearance of nourishment - accumulation of thirst, or at least from disappearance of thirst - accumulation of nourishment)</li>
        <li><a href="/r/?q=an4.199&s=ta%E1%B9%87ha#2.2">an4.199</a> - Listed phenomena are so subtle that on the contrary, thirst can be their result, but to call 'I - am' and further thirst or its currents, in the meaning of 'acute need of something' is very difficult. In this passage we are talking about subtle, fundamental states that are inherent even to beings devoid of 'thirst' in the generally accepted meaning of this word.</li>
        <li><a href="/r/?q=an4.9&s=ta%E1%B9%87ha#2.1">an4.9</a> - Thirst is not the source of pain, but either one of the types of pain, or on the contrary, it is striving to stop something unpleasant. Otherwise it would turn out that thirst for water is the cause of unpleasant sensations of dryness. But on the contrary, thirst as striving to drink is the result of unpleasant sensations of dryness.</li>
        <li><a href="/r/?q=an6.61&s=ta%E1%B9%87ha#12.4">an6.61</a> - Listed phenomena including phasso can be so subtle that there can be no talk of any thirst in figurative, or even direct sense of the word, especially in moments of 'quenched thirst', but still these phenomena are stitched and held together, whether there is 'strong wanting' or not. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    In Pali texts taṇhā has more complex, more subtle and less loud meaning than English word "thirst" in direct and figurative. And mechanical equation of two Pali terms taṇhā and tasinā with Sanskrit tṛṣṇā.</p>

<p>3. <code>kāma</code>:
    <ul>
        <li><a href="/r/?q=an6.63&s=k%C4%81m#8.10">an6.63</a> - desires as intention-blank-passion, not just multipliers of desire (kama gunas).</li>
        <li><a href="/r/?q=an6.63&s=k%C4%81mayam%C4%81no#12.1">an6.63 (continuation)</a> - desiring person obtains either good or not-good, but "sensual" desires would lead to not-good as they would contain akusalamula: lobha, dosa and/or moha.</li>
    </ul>

    <li>
<code> Puriso attha-<strong>kāmo</strong> hita-<strong>kāmo</strong> yogakkhema-<strong>kāmo</strong>ti kho, bhikkhave, tathāgatassetaṁ adhivacanaṁ arahato sammāsambuddhassa.</code>

“A person, desiring good, desiring benefit, desiring protection from yoke”, monks, of Tathagata this is the designation, of Arahant, of Rightly Awakened. <a href="https://dhamma.gift/r/?s=hitak%C4%81m&q=mn19#26.10">mn19</a><br><br>
it would be inappropriate to assume that Tathagata would compare himself with a person passionately desiring others' good, or his own.
</li>        
    </p>

    <p>4. <code>kamma</code>:
    <ul>
        <li><a href="/r/?q=an4.237&s=kamma#5.1">an4.237</a> - Right View, Right Mindfulness, Right Samadhi - do not fit the concept of action, possibly with stretch activity, but obviously these are much more subtle phenomena than only deed, work, action</li>
        <li><a href="/r/?q=an4.238&s=kamma#4.1">an4.238</a> - Mindfulness-awakening-aspect, rapture-awakening-aspect, tranquility-awakening-aspect, samadhi-awakening-aspect, direct-seeing-awakening-aspect - do not fit the concept of action, possibly with stretch activity, but obviously these are much more subtle phenomena than only deed, work, action</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>Listed texts show that Pali <code>dukkha</code>, <code>taṇhā / tasinā</code>, <code>kāma</code>, <code>kamma</code> never were full analogs neither of Sanskrit equivalents, nor of their designations in English translations, but precisely "suffering", "thirst", "action" and "sensual desire" - this is "standard", universally used Buddhist terminology.</p>

    <p>With the above in mind, in cases where Pali texts indeed lack context or examples, Sanskrit still can be used — provided that this does not lead to contradictions like listed ones. If definition of concept exists in Pali, but Sanskrit meanings contradict them, then the latter are not applied.</p>

<p> <a id="ast1" href="#ast1Back">1*</a> By contextual translation is meant using different words for the same word in Pali. Systemic translation implies more complex analysis of all occurrences of a word or concept in Suttas and Vinaya and finding universal, common word or word cluster (preferably close but clarifying).</p>

<p> <a id="ast2" href="#ast2Back">3*</a> Partially described below problems may be connected not so much with Sanskrit, but with contextual translation.

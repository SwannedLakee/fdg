    <h2>Principles of Literal Word-for-Word Translation – Pali-English</h2>
    <h5>Principles and approaches applied in cases of "translation o" - text fully translated from Pali, or "ed. o" - text fragment modified according to the Pali original according to these Principles.</h5>

<p><em>(Note: This document is a translation from the Russian original. Some of the linguistic examples and discussions of nuance are best understood with reference to the source language. <a href="./o.html">Original document in Russian</a>)</em></p>

        <h4>In The Middle: Between Adaptation and Grammatical Analysis</h4>
    <p>
This approach to literal translations does not require that all translations follow this method. Its goal is to fill the vacant niche between the numerous artistic adaptations and complex grammatical analyses. A literal translation acts as a necessary "bridge," allowing one to see the original structure of the text and the logic of the Dhamma directly, with little to no immersion in linguistics. It is the missing link for those who seek greater precision and independence in studying the original sources but have not yet learned Pali to the required level.
    </p>

<h2>Principles</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Any translation from Pali or translation of another author's translation, whether it's a complete text, text fragment, dictionary entry, topical article, or simply a term translation, in digital, printed, or oral form, as of today (<span id="date"></span>) is not considered final but is regarded as <strong>"Work in Progress"</strong> in preparation.  
            To obtain a final translation, meanings and terms must be correctly established.  
            If such a translation is possible, it can only be done by an Arahant with the four "analytical knowledges"  
            (<a href="/read/?s=pa%E1%B9%ADisambhid&q=an4.172#0.3">catasso paṭisambhidā</a>).
        </li>
        
        <script>
            const now = new Date();
            const formattedDate = String(now.getDate()).padStart(2, '0') + '-' +
                                String(now.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0') + '-' +
                                now.getFullYear();
            document.getElementById("date").textContent = formattedDate;
        </script>
        
        <li>Terminology in the Buddha's Teaching must be <strong>consistent</strong>, this is an integral part of any adequate instructions and documents, not to mention the Supreme Teacher and Supreme Teaching describing the most subtle, fundamental principles of the universe's workings and methods of its realization. Dhamma is <strong>not</strong> fiction. Meanings and definitions are uniform across all texts, especially those concerning the Four Noble Truths and adjacent layers of text. More details in <a href="./rationale-en.html">"Rationale"</a></li>   
        <li>If a concept has a definition in the suttas, that meaning is applied. Example: dukkha has definitions in the suttas. "Pain (dukkha) is bodily pain, bodily discomfort..." (Sutta "Analysis of Truths" <a href="/read/?q=mn141&s=dukkha&lang=pli-rus#16.1">mn141</a>) also in <a href="./rationale-en.html">"Rationale"</a>. Ignoring direct term definitions from the suttas is considered a sub-optimal approach that renders the entire Buddha’s Teaching not well-formulated (not svākkhāto).</li>

         <li>
          If a concept has a definition in the suttas, that meaning is applied. Example: dukkha has definitions in the suttas.
          “Pain (dukkha) is bodily pain, bodily discomfort…” (Sutta “Analysis of Truths”
          <a href="/read/?q=mn141&s=dukkha&lang=pli-rus#16.1">mn141</a>).<br><br>

          Practical example: in the suttas, when the Pali word <strong>dukkha</strong> (bodily pain, bodily discomfort) is used, it points the reader toward the level of phenomena such as <strong>rūpa</strong> and <strong>vedanā</strong>. However, in translations lacking
          consistent terminology, where <strong>dukkha</strong> is rendered as “suffering,” the reader’s attention is shifted instead to the levels of <strong>saññā</strong> and <strong>saṅkhārā</strong>.<br><br>

          See details in the <a href="./rationale-en.html">“Rationale”</a> section. Ignoring direct term definitions from the suttas is considered a sub-optimal approach that renders the entire Buddha’s Teaching not well-formulated (not svākkhāto).
        </li>

        <li>If a definition cannot be found in the suttas but can be found in the Vinaya Vibhaṅga (hereinafter Vinaya), that meaning is applied.</li>
        <li>
            If a word's definition is found neither in the suttas nor in the Vinaya, then a systemic translation is preferred over a contextual one<a id="ast1Back" href="#ast1">*</a>. That is, ideally one word that maximally covers all usage contexts in all or most cases of its occurrence in the suttas and Vinaya. More about contextual translation issues in <a href="./rationale-en.html">"Rationale"</a>.
        </li>
        <li>If a word occurs too rarely or in monotonous cases, and it has no definition in the suttas and Vinaya, then a contextual or dictionary meaning is used.</li>     
        <li>
            If a generally accepted translation or interpretation, including from a commentary or sub-commentary of any concept, contradicts the above points — such translation or interpretation are not applied.
        </li>  
        
        <li>
            If a Pali concept is broader than a single concept in English, then a word cluster or a separate word from the cluster is used. Example: rāga — passion-enchantment, anicca — unreliability, instability, untrustworthiness. Such a cluster may be used at the first occurrence of the word in the text, further in the text only one key word is used. As if it were written: passion-enchantment (hereinafter passion). Or jhāyatha - ignite (ardently strive, concentrate, "meditate", contemplate), further ignite.
        </li>        
        <li>
            If a Pali concept is more specific, while the English concept is broader, then a clarification is used. Example: ceto — mind-thinking, citta — mind-state, mano — mind-representation. As if it were written: mind-state (hereinafter mind).
        </li>                
        <li>Preserving the word order in the Pali sentence is preferred.</li>
        <li>Preserving Pali grammatical structure is preferred.</li>
 <li>It's preferable to preserve the structure of words with negative prefixes in Pali. For example: byapada and abyapada — "hostility" and "non-hostility." But not "hostility" and "friendliness."
</li> 
        <li>Case endings are used only in cases where the form without them sounds completely unnatural in English. However, when possible, it's recommended to omit case endings within compound words<a id="ast8Back" href="#ast8">*</a>, preserving their open, polysemantic structure.  Open approach to understanding compound words implies, for example: Noble-Truth - this is both truth of the Noble, and truth leading to nobility, and from nobles, and for becoming noble, and for nobles.
        </li>
        <li>
            In cases of semantic divergence, the translation should be based on the meaning of the Pali term — just as is done with "false friends of the translator"<a id="ast5Back" href="#ast5">*</a>, that is, not by external similarity with English equivalents. More details — in section <a href="./rationale-en.html">"Rationale"</a>.
        </li>
    </ol>

<p> <a id="ast1" href="#ast1Back">1*</a> By contextual translation is meant using different words for the same word in Pali. Systemic translation implies more complex analysis of all occurrences of a word or concept in Suttas and Vinaya and finding universal, common word or word cluster (preferably close but clarifying).</p>

<p> <a id="ast8" href="#ast8Back">2*</a> 
    In addition to the standard, commonly accepted understanding of Pali compound words—as described, for example, <a href="https://www.digitalpalireader.online/docs/pali/compound.htm">here</a>—it is proposed to take an even broader view of compounds.

    <br><br>
    Similar to dash in dates "1-10" (from first to tenth) is not equal only to "1 and 10" — so in Pali compound words, for example, "ascetics-brahmins", does not mean only "ascetics and brahmins", but the whole range of representatives of spiritual sphere — from ascetics to brahmins. In the same way the whole spectrum of phenomena from joy to passion, as in case of <code class="lang-pli" lang="pi">nandīrāga</code>, and not only joy and passion.
    <br><br>
But as described earlier, case endings will be used for words which don't have suitable form of compound word in English, for example, instead of "sufferingo-lamentationo-paino-discontento-despair" will be "suffering-lamentation-pain-discontent-despair" although the first is implied. 
</p>

    <p> <a id="ast3" href="#ast3Back">4*</a> 
        In English<br> 
<strong>pain</strong>:
    <ul>
        <li><strong>[meaning 1]</strong> in direct sense: wide spectrum of unpleasant bodily sensations.</li>
        <li><strong>[meaning 2]</strong> in figurative sense - problem, limitation, inconvenience, something requiring solution and improvement. "Pain of loneliness", "customer pain".</li>
    </ul></p>
      <p> <strong>suffering</strong>:
    <ul>
        <li><strong>[meaning 1]</strong> in direct sense: very strong both bodily and mental pain simultaneously or separately.</li>
        <li><strong>[meaning 2]</strong> in figurative sense - mental pain, mental discomfort.</li>
    </ul>
</p>


<p> <a id="ast5" href="#ast5Back">5*</a> 
False friends of the translator — words formally similar, but with partial or distorted coincidence of meanings.<br><br>

Examples from English and Russian languages:<br> 
Aggressive — "energetic and also aggressive" and "only aggressive, not connected with energy".<br>
Sympathy — "compassion" and симпатия — "attraction"<br><br>
</p>
<p> <a id="ast6" href="#ast6Back">6*</a> 
False cognates — words similar in sound and origin, but with different meaning.<br>
Examples from English and Russian languages:<br> 
Fabric — "cloth" and фабрика — "factory"<br>
Magazine — "periodical" and магазин — "store"
</p>

<p> <a id="ast2" href="#ast2Back">7*</a> Partially described below problems may be connected not so much with Sanskrit, but with contextual translation. Since most of suitable meanings can be found in Sanskrit dictionaries too. But still translator's choice in favor of what is not in Suttas and Vinaya should be justified by something, apart from tradition (including translation tradition), and often it is precisely references to Sanskrit.</p>

<p> <a id="ast4" href="#ast4Back">8*</a> Word tasina itself is not found in all editions of canon, but its derivative tasito is found in vast majority of editions in metaphors with one exhausted from heat and thirst.</p>

<h3>Chapter&nbsp;4: Food</h3>

	<div id="metaarea">
		<ul class="translator">
		<li>By Thannissaro Bhikkhu</li>
		</ul>
</div>

<p>The three main classes of food — staple foods, non-staple foods, and juice drinks — have already been discussed in BMC1 under the <a href="../bmc/bmc1.8-4.html">Food Chapter</a> of the pācittiya rules. The question of making fruit allowable has been discussed under <a href="../bmc/bmc1.8-2.html#pc11">Pācittiya&nbsp;11</a>. Here we will discuss aspects of the topic of food not covered in those passages.</p>

<p><b>Cooking &amp; storing foods.</b> One may not consume food stored indoors, cooked indoors, or cooked by oneself. There is a separate dukkaṭa for each of these actions. Thus, if one consumes food stored indoors that one has cooked oneself, one incurs two dukkaṭas. According to the Commentary, <i>indoors</i> here means in an <i>akappiya-kuṭi</i> (a building that has not been designated as a food storage place) that would count as a “same lodging” with a bhikkhu under <a href="../bmc/bmc1.8-1.html#pc5">Pācittiya&nbsp;5</a> &amp; <a href="../bmc/bmc1.8-1.html#pc6">6</a>. <i>Stored</i> means kept overnight, even if the food has not been formally offered. (<a href="../bmc/bmc1.8-4.html#pc38">Pācittiya&nbsp;38</a> imposes a pācittiya on eating food kept overnight after it has been formally offered, regardless of where it has been kept.) Food stored or cooked in a food storage place <i>(kappiya-kuṭi</i> — see <a href="../bmc/bmc2.7.html">Chapter&nbsp;7</a>) doesn’t count as stored or cooked indoors. A lay person’s residence automatically counts as a kappiya-kuṭi, so a bhikkhu staying in such a place would be able to eat food that the lay person had stored and cooked there. These storing and cooking prohibitions apply only to staple foods, non-staple foods, and juice drinks, and not to medicines and tonics. However, if a medicine or tonic stored indoors is later mixed with food that has been kept in a kappiya-kuṭi, the resulting mixture counts as food stored indoors.</p>

<p>Although a bhikkhu may not cook his food himself, the Canon allows him to reheat for his own use food that has already been cooked by another.</p>

<p>The Meṇḍaka allowance (<a href="../vi/kd6.html">Khandhaka&nbsp;6 (Mv&nbsp;6)</a>) for gathering provisions for a journey is discussed under <a href="../bmc/bmc1.8-4.html#pc39">Pācittiya&nbsp;39</a>.</p>

<p><b>Eating.</b> A bhikkhu should not eat from the same dish or drink from the same cup with anyone else at all, lay or ordained. The Commentary adds here, however, that if Bhikkhu X takes fruit from a dish and goes away, Bhikkhu Y may then take food from the same dish. After Bhikkhu Y goes away, Bhikkhu X may then come back for more. In other words, the prohibition is against using the same dish, etc., in the presence of another person who is also using it.</p>

<p>There is also a prohibition against eating from a food warmer (made of metal or wood, says the Commentary), which the V/Sub-commentary explains as a bowl-like container into which hot water is poured, and over which is placed a bowl for keeping the food. A bhikkhu who is ill, however, may eat from a raised tray. The Commentary says that this allowance extends to trays made of wickerware or wood.</p>

<p>A bhikkhu who regurgitates his food is allowed to swallow it again as long as it has not come out of his mouth. The Commentary defines <i>out of his mouth</i> as meaning sticking in the mouth. In other words, when regurgitated food comes into the mouth, one may swallow it if it flows back down the throat, but not if it stays in the mouth. The Commentary here is interpreting <i>mukha-dvāra,</i> literally the door of the face, as the larynx, and not the opening of the lips. Under <a href="../bmc/bmc1.8-4.html#pc40">Pācittiya&nbsp;40</a> I argued against this interpretation, noting that <a href="../mn/mn140.html">MN140</a> treats the mukha-dvāra as separate from the space “whereby what has been eaten, drunk, consumed, and savored gets swallowed.” The larynx belongs to the second space; this leaves the mouth for the first. The awkwardness of the Commentary’s interpretation here is yet another argument against taking mukha-dvāra to mean larynx — why food stuck in the mouth would be counted as outside the larynx but food that doesn’t get stuck would not, is hard to explain. A more reasonable interpretation would be the common-sense one: Regurgitated food may be swallowed again, even if it gets stuck in the mouth, but not if brought out of the mouth.</p>

<p><b>Famine allowances.</b> The following actions, normally not allowed, are allowable during a famine: One may eat what has been stored indoors, cooked indoors, and cooked by oneself. If there is non-staple fruit and there is no one to make it allowable, one may pick it up and carry it away. If one meets an unordained person who can make it allowable, one may put the fruit on the ground and then consume it after having formally received it from that person. If one has eaten and turned down an offer of further food, one may still consume food that has not been made “leftover” (see <a href="../bmc/bmc1.8-4.html#pc35">Pācittiya&nbsp;35</a>) if it was brought back from where the meal was, if it was formally accepted before the meal, or if it is food that has grown in the woods or in a lotus pond — apparently these last two were places where people would go foraging during a famine.</p>

<p><b>Garlic.</b> There is a prohibition against eating garlic unless one is ill. According to the Commentary, <i>ill</i> here means any illness for which garlic is a cure. Traditionally, garlic is used as an antibiotic and to ward off colds and flu. According to current medical knowledge, it also helps prevent high blood cholesterol. Although Asian food often contains garlic as an ingredient, none of the texts mention the use of garlic mixed in with food. Perhaps it is allowable on the grounds of being a digestive aid. An alternative interpretation, accepted by many Communities, is that the original prohibition is against eating garlic by itself. Following this interpretation, garlic mixed with other ingredients would be allowable even when one is not ill.</p>

<p><b>Green gram.</b> <a href="../vi/kd6.html">Khandhaka&nbsp;6 (Mv&nbsp;6)</a> tells of an incident in which Ven. Kaṅkha-Revata saw a heap of excrement out of which green gram (a mung bean) had sprouted. Noting that green gram, even when digested, can still sprout, he wondered if it might be allowable. The Buddha assured him that it was.</p>

<p>“Those things that were allowed by me for the bhikkhus when food was scarce, crops bad, and almsfood difficult to obtain: what was stored indoors, cooked indoors, cooked by oneself, accepting formally what was picked up; what was taken back from there; what was formally accepted before the meal; what grows in the woods; what grows in a lotus pond: From this day forward I rescind them. One should not consume what is stored indoors, cooked indoors, cooked by oneself; or what was formally accepted after having been picked up: Whoever should consume it: an offense of wrong doing. Nor should one, having eaten and been satisfied, consume food that is not left over if it is brought back from there (the place where the meal was offered), if it was formally accepted before the meal, if it grows in the woods or a lotus pond. Whoever should consume these is to be dealt with in accordance with the rule (<a href="../bmc/bmc1.8-4.html#pc35">Pācittiya&nbsp;35</a>).” — <a href="../vi/kd6.html">Khandhaka&nbsp;6 (Mv&nbsp;6)</a></p>

Life-long medicine mixed with time-period food, when received that day, is allowable in the time period, but not outside of the time period.
